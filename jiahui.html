   <h1>Hi there!</h1>
   <img><img src="image/jiahui_avatar.png" alt="short description" style="width:500px;height:500px;" class="center">

   <p1>My name is Jia Hui. I'm a Year 2 student in NUS, currently studying Industrial Design. I have had an interest in arts and design since a young age, but have not had a serious chance to pursue it until now. I have a strong interest in creating simple and beautiful form, yet useful in it's function and context. I want to be able to create meaningful things that can relate and speak to people.</p1>


   <h2>My strengthes as a designer are...</h2>
   
    <ul>
      <li>I am an open-minded person and flexible in ways. It is enlightening to hear about other people's opinions and different viewpoints allows me to become more able to empathise with others.</li>

      <li>I am always learning how to improve myself, to become more well equipped with technical skills, to be better at communicating my ideas through drawing/sketches or presentation skills.</li>
     
      <li>I am responsible and will keep close to agreed deadlines and submissions, no matter if itâ€™s school works or client works.</li>
     
      <li>I am lucky to have an awesome support group of friends who will give me honest opinions and advice for improvements, and cheer for support.</li>
    </ul>
