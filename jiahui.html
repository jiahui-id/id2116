   <h1>Hi My name is Jia Hui</h1>
   <p>My name is Jia Hui. I'm a Year 2 student in NUS, currently studying Industrial Design. I have had an interest in arts and design since a young age, but have not had a serious chance to pursue it until now. I have a strong interest in creating simple and beautiful form, yet useful in it's function and context. I want to be able to create meaningful things that can relate and speak to people.</p>
