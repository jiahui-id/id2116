            Hello, I'm a Year 2 student in NUS, currently studying Industrial Design. 
            I have had an interest in arts and design since a young age, but have not had 
            a serious chance to pursue it until now. I have a strong interest in creating 
            simple and beautiful form, yet useful in it's function and context. I want to 
            be able to create meaningful things that can relate and speak to people.

          </p>
