   <h1>My name is Tan Shieh Chih</h1>
   <p>I am a currently studying Industrial Design in National University of Singapore. I am mainly interested to explore product design, experience design and visual communication. I participated in a few individual and group design projects over the past three semesters, including school projects and one student group project with Shiseido. I have also learnt skills such as design thinking and building prototypes.</p>

   <h2>My strengths as a designer are collaboration, empathy, drawing and technical skills.</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I am good in collaborating with others when engaged in a groupwork. I am open to other membersâ€™ suggestions. I will contribute ideas and can help with CAD or simple animation.</li>
      <li>I can empathise with other people relatively well. This helps me better understand their problems and thus solve them through design. </li>
      <li>I can draw relatively well. I use sketches and technical drawing to communicate my design ideas. </li>
      <li>I am well equipped with many software required for design. These include Adobe Photoshop, Illustration, After Effects, Rhinoceros and Grasshopper.</li>
    </ul>
